_Note:_ This is a sort of _change-log_ plus some additional meta-information meant to give some insight
into the _development process_ to potential evaluators of the exercise. It wouldn't be part of the
project itself out of the context of the take-home test.

 - #1 Project is set up with Maven. A basic `pom.xml` is created with initial configuration, and a
   generic _truth-test_ is set up to verify JUnit is working correctly. Maven wrappers are included
   as a courtesy, just in case.
 - For now, development will be done on the **master** branch.
 - I've decided to use JCommander to parse command line arguments. It's simple enough and works reasonably well.
